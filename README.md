# ai-to-z

This is my personal rendition of the Webby award-winning [A to Z of AI](https://atozofai.withgoogle.com/intl/en-US/). Its not perfect, but I learned a lot by trying to clone this site.

If I were to do it again, the main thing I would change is I would make each content page modular instead of hand coding them. I thought it would be easier to hand code them, but since there are 26 pages it turned out to be a lot more work than just taking a smarter approach from the start, although it did provide more practice reps. It took me about four hours to code all the pages how I did them, when it would have taken probably 30 minutes if I had made a reusable view. Plus, I would be able to then easily update the site if I had based the content on a view. There were also some smaller opportunities to put redundant elements into individual components. If I was going to maintain this site going forward I would refactor the whole thing and probabily use a global stylesheet rather than scoped css for every page.
